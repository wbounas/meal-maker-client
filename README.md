### **About**

This app was inspired by the feeling of going home almost every night, and not having the energy or time to think of a meal to cook. The thought was, that if you’re consciously trying to eat better, you can use this app to help you come up with meal ideas while you’re away from home!

Meal[Maker] allows you to create a virtual “fridge”, where you can add in ingredients you know you have, and keep a list of those ingredients with information about each one saved to your account. You can also remove an ingredient if you already ate it, and update an ingredient if something about it changed.

Each ingredient that you create can have the following properties:

* Name - the name of the ingredient
* Unit - the unit-size used when using the ingredient while cooking
* Quantity - the amount of the ingredient
* Notes (optional) - any information you’d like to add to that specific ingredient

### **Planned Future Versions**

In the next iterations of this app, I plan to add another user-owned resource (meals), and establish a many-to-many relationship between ingredients and meals. Then, I would create a way for the user to add ingredients to a meal that don’t exist in their fridge, and add them to a separate “Grocery List” so the user can keep track of what they’ll need to create the perfect meal. That way, the functionality of my vision for the app will be realized!
